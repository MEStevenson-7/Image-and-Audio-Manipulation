## Project Summary

This project centers around:
- Reading and writing images using the PIL library.
- Representing RGB images as Python lists.
- Using custom classes like `RGBImage` for structured image manipulation.
- Handling audio files using the `pydub` library to perform basic audio transformations.
- Reinforcing class-based design, modularity, and abstraction with real-world data.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy` for array handling
- `PIL` (`Pillow`) for image input/output and format conversion
- `pydub` for reading, converting, and modifying audio files
- `os` for file path management
